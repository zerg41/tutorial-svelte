  /** The full list of modifiers:
   * - preventDefault — calls event.preventDefault() before running the handler. Useful for client-side form handling, for example.
   * - stopPropagation — calls event.stopPropagation(), preventing the event reaching the next element
   * - passive — improves scrolling performance on touch/wheel events (Svelte will add it automatically where it's safe to do so)
   * - nonpassive — explicitly set passive: false
   * - capture — fires the handler during the capture phase instead of the bubbling phase
   * - once — remove the handler after the first time it runs
   * - self — only trigger handler if event.target is the element itself
   * - trusted — only trigger handler if event.isTrusted is true, meaning the event was triggered by a user action rather
   *             than because some JavaScript called element.dispatchEvent(...)
   * You can chain modifiers together, e.g. on:click|once|capture={...}.
